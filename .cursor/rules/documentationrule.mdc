Whenever major changes or features are being added update or add information to developer documentation if there is no developer documentation create one

For the general flow of the project put it to [documentation.txt](mdc:documentation/documentation.txt)

If there are major systems that require a separate documentation make another .txt file in the same folder as [documentation.txt](mdc:documentation/documentation.txt)

As for the setup of the project from git cloning or pulling update the README.md for the user as a guide in setting up the project
