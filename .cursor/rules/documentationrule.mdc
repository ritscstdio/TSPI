Whenever major changes or features are being added update or add information to developer documentation if there is no developer documentation create one

For the general flow of the project put it to [documentation.txt](mdc:documentation/documentation.txt)

If there are major systems that require a separate documentation make another .txt file in the same folder as [documentation.txt](mdc:documentation/documentation.txt)

As for the setup of the project from git cloning or pulling update the README.md for the user as a guide in setting up the project

**Fixed Navbar Offset Rule:**

1.  **Identify Navigation Targets:** Whenever an HTML element is given an `id` attribute for the primary purpose of being an in-page navigation target (i.e., linked via an anchor like `#some-id`), that element MUST have `scroll-margin-top` applied.

2.  **Use CSS Custom Properties:**
    *   Define the primary navbar's height as a CSS custom property in a global stylesheet (e.g., `src/css/mainstyles.css`):
        ```css
        :root {
            --navbar-height: 166px; /* Or the actual current height */
            --navbar-scroll-offset: calc(var(--navbar-height) + 24px); /* Base height + buffer */
        }
        ```
    *   Use `var(--navbar-scroll-offset)` for the `scroll-margin-top` value on all navigation target elements.
    *   Use `var(--navbar-height)` for the global `padding-top` on the `<main>` element (or equivalent main content wrapper).

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   For new sections/pages: Proactively apply the `id` and the `scroll-margin-top: var(--navbar-scroll-offset);` style to elements that will be linked to.
    *   For existing pages: If new anchor links are added, audit the target elements to ensure this rule is applied.

**Example:**
In HTML: `<section id="my-section">...</section>`
In CSS: `#my-section { scroll-margin-top: var(--navbar-scroll-offset); }`

By consistently applying this, we ensure that content isn't hidden behind the fixed navbar when navigating via anchor links.
