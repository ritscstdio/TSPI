EVERYTIME THERE IS AN SQL QUERY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED OR CHANGED

Remember there is already an existing database
REMEMBER THAT YOU CANNOT LOOK FOR THE SQL USING COMMANDS EVEN WITH POWERSHELL IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

So if I were required to change/add a table or structure. Always refer to the SQL I will send along with the prompt.


And the suggestion or answer you will give will be relevant to the SQL file I will provide so I won't have errors in phpmyadmin.
