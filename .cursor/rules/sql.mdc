EVERYTIME THERE IS AN SQL QUERY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED OR CHANGED

REMEMBER I AM USING XAMPP AND YOU CANNOT ACCES THE DATABASE USING PHP EITHER I GIVE TO YOU OR NOT

Remember there is already an existing database
REMEMBER THAT YOU CANNOT LOOK FOR THE SQL USING COMMANDS EVEN WITH POWERSHELL IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

So if I were required to change/add a table or structure. Always refer to the SQL I will send along with the prompt.


And the suggestion or answer you will give will be relevant to the SQL file I will provide so I won't have errors in phpmyadmin.
