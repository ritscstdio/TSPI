EVERYTIME THERE IS AN SQL QUERY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED OR CHANGED

Remember there is already an existing database

So if I were required to change/add a table or structure. Always refer to the SQL I will send along with the prompt.


And the suggestion or answer you will give will be relevant to the SQL file I will provide so I won't have errors in phpmyadmin.
