                        <p>Rooted in <strong><em>Christian faith</em></strong>, Tulay sa Pag-unlad, Inc. (TSPI) is a <strong><em>non-profit microfinance organization</em></strong> dedicated to social development. We empower the marginalized by offering programs and services that reflect Christ's call to share His grace and love with the poor (Luke 4:18). Partnering with various institutions, TSPI strives to <strong><em>alleviate poverty</em></strong> by equipping microentrepreneurs and small farmers to build thriving livelihoods while fostering their spiritual growth. We believe these ventures are blessings from God, serving as a "<strong><em>bridge to progress</em></strong>" (tulay sa pag-unlad) for our clients.</p>
                        <p>Inspired by Jesus' <strong><em>miraculous feeding of the multitude</em></strong> (Luke 9:10-17), TSPI began with the principle that even small offerings, when entrusted to God, can yield abundance. Starting with modest resources, we provided micro-loans and business guidance to budding entrepreneurs. Over time, as resources grew, TSPI's <strong><em>transformative mission</em></strong> expanded, becoming a conduit of blessings for numerous individuals and families. God's unwavering faithfulness has sustained TSPI through the years, guiding our response to the evolving needs of our clients. As it is written, "<strong><em>I am He, I am He who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.</em></strong>" â God (Isaiah 46:4).</p>
                        <p>Established on <strong><em>October 30, 1981</em></strong>, TSPI <strong><em>pioneered the microfinance industry</em></strong> in the Philippines. Driven by our gospel-centered mission and a deep desire to reach more communities, TSPI forged local alliances with like-minded organizations and individuals. This led to the creation of six independent provincial microfinance NGO partners nationwide. Furthermore, TSPI played a key role in establishing <strong><em>sustainability standards</em></strong> for microfinance NGOs through a national coalition. We proudly stand as a <strong><em>founding member</em></strong> of the two largest microfinance networks in the Philippines: the Alliance of Philippine Partners in Enterprise Development, Inc. (APPEND) in 1991 and the Microfinance Council of the Philippines, Inc. (MCPI) in 1999.</p>
