# "Our Branches" Section Documentation (`AboutUs.php`)

This document outlines the structure, styling, and interactive features of the "Our Branches" section on the `AboutUs.php` page.

## Overview

The "Our Branches" section provides a comprehensive listing of TSPI's branches, organized by region and province. It also features details about the TSPI Head Office, including an image carousel.

## Structure and Layout

1.  **TSPI Head Office:**
    *   Displayed at the top of the section.
    *   Includes an image carousel showcasing multiple views of the head office (e.g., 4 images).
    *   Contact details (address, phone numbers) are provided below the carousel.

2.  **Branch Listings:**
    *   Branches are grouped by **Region**.
    *   Within each Region, branches are further grouped by **Province**.
    *   **Collapsible Elements:**
        *   Both Region names and Province names act as headers for collapsible sections (dropdowns).
        *   Users can click on a Region or Province header to expand or collapse the list of branches/provinces within it.
        *   Chevron icons (or similar visual cues) indicate the expanded/collapsed state and rotate on click.
    *   **Branch Item Display:**
        *   Inside each expanded Province, individual branch locations are listed.
        *   The layout for branch items within a province has been styled as a 2-column grid on wider screens to improve readability and space utilization.
        *   Each branch item typically displays its name/address and contact number(s).

## Key Functionalities

1.  **Head Office Image Carousel:**
    *   A CSS-based image carousel displays multiple images of the TSPI Head Office.
    *   Typically includes navigation controls (e.g., previous/next buttons or dots) for manual image browsing.
    *   May also feature automatic image rotation.

2.  **Collapsible Regions and Provinces:**
    *   **Purpose:** To manage the potentially long list of branches and allow users to focus on specific areas of interest.
    *   **Implementation:** JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility (e.g., `max-height` and `opacity` for smooth animations) of the content within each region and province when its header is clicked.
    *   CSS classes are often added/removed to control the styling and state of the collapsible elements and their trigger icons (e.g., chevron rotation).

3.  **Copy-to-Clipboard for Addresses:**
    *   Users can click on a branch's address to copy it to their clipboard.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., a temporary message like "Address Copied!") is provided to confirm the action.
    *   This functionality is implemented using JavaScript to interact with the browser's Clipboard API.
    *   Initially, there was also copy-to-clipboard for phone numbers, but this was later removed, leaving only address copying.

4.  **Styling and Animations:**
    *   Modern styling is applied to the collapsible headers (background, padding, font treatment).
    *   Smooth transition effects (e.g., `max-height`, `opacity`) are used for the expand/collapse animations of regions and provinces.
    *   Spacing between branch items and between main Region headers has been adjusted for a cleaner look.

## Navigation

*   The "Our Branches" section is a main section within `AboutUs.php` and is linked in the sticky side navigation of the page.
*   Initially, sub-links for each Region were considered for the sticky nav but were later removed to keep the side navigation concise.

## Technical Details (Illustrative)

*   **HTML Structure (Conceptual for a collapsible region/province):
    ```html
    <div class="region-header collapsible-trigger">
        Region Name <span class="chevron">▼</span>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content region-content">
        <div class="province-header collapsible-trigger">
            Province Name <span class="chevron">▼</span>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-content province-content">
            <div class="branch-grid">
                <!-- Branch items in 2-column layout -->
                <div class="branch-item">
                    <p class="branch-address" title="Click to copy address">Branch Address 1...</p>
                    <p>Contact: 123-4567</p>
                </div>
                <!-- ... more branch items ... -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- ... more provinces ... -->
    </div>
    <!-- ... more regions ... -->
    ```

*   **JavaScript (Conceptual for collapsibles and copy-to-clipboard):
    ```javascript
    // Collapsible sections
    document.querySelectorAll('.collapsible-trigger').forEach(trigger => {
        trigger.addEventListener('click', function() {
            this.classList.toggle('active');
            const content = this.nextElementSibling;
            if (content.style.maxHeight) {
                content.style.maxHeight = null;
                content.style.opacity = '0';
            } else {
                content.style.maxHeight = content.scrollHeight + "px";
                content.style.opacity = '1';
            }
            // Toggle chevron icon if present
            const chevron = this.querySelector('.chevron');
            if (chevron) {
                chevron.style.transform = this.classList.contains('active') ? 'rotate(180deg)' : 'rotate(0deg)';
            }
        });
    });

    // Copy address to clipboard
    document.querySelectorAll('.branch-address').forEach(addressEl => {
        addressEl.addEventListener('click', function() {
            navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.innerText)
                .then(() => {
                    // Show feedback, e.g., a temporary tooltip or message
                    console.log('Address copied!');
                    // Example: show a message next to the element
                    const feedback = document.createElement('span');
                    feedback.textContent = ' Copied!';
                    this.appendChild(feedback);
                    setTimeout(() => feedback.remove(), 2000);
                })
                .catch(err => console.error('Failed to copy: ', err));
        });
    });
    ```
