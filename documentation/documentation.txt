## Global Page Layout and Navbar

The website uses a fixed header/navbar at the top of the page. To ensure page content is not obscured by this fixed navbar, a global CSS rule applies `padding-top: 166px;` (calculated based on the navbar's height) to the main HTML5 `<main>` element of all pages.

### Homepage Exception:

The homepage (`homepage.php`) is an exception. Its hero section is designed to appear directly under the navbar, with the navbar potentially overlaying the top portion of the hero's background video/image.
To achieve this:
1. `homepage.php` sets a PHP variable `$body_class = 'homepage-body';`.
2. This adds a class `homepage-body` to the `<body>` tag via `includes/header.php`.
3. A CSS rule `body.homepage-body main { padding-top: 0; }` in `src/css/mainstyles.css` overrides the global `padding-top` for the main content area of the homepage, allowing the hero section (the first child of `<main>`) to extend to the top of the viewport.

This setup ensures that new pages created will automatically have their main content start below the navbar, while the homepage maintains its specific hero section layout.

## Cookie Consent Banner

A cookie consent banner is implemented to inform users about cookie usage and to obtain consent. It appears on all pages if the user has not previously accepted the cookie policy.

### Components:
1.  **HTML (in `includes/footer.php`):** Defines the structure of the banner, including a message, a link to the Privacy Policy page (`privacy.php`), and an "Accept" button.
2.  **CSS (in `src/css/mainstyles.css`):** Styles for `.cookie-consent-banner` and its child elements, ensuring it is fixed at the bottom right with a dark theme, consistent with company standards.
3.  **JavaScript (in `includes/footer.php`):
    *   Checks for a cookie named `tspi_cookie_consent` on page load.
    *   If the cookie is not found (new visitor or cookie expired), the banner is displayed (`banner.style.display = 'block';`).
    *   When the "Accept" button is clicked:
        *   A cookie named `tspi_cookie_consent` is set with the value `true` and an expiration of 365 days.
        *   The banner is hidden (`banner.style.display = 'none';`).
4.  **Privacy Policy Page (`privacy.php`):** A new page created with placeholder privacy policy content. It links from the cookie banner and the main site footer.

This ensures users are informed about cookie usage and can provide consent, which is stored for a year.

## About Us Page (AboutUs.php)

### Structure:
- Main container: `<main><div class="about-us-container">`
- Sections:
    - "About TSPI (Tulay Sa Pag-unlad Inc.) - NGO": Contains intro text, embedded YouTube video, Vision, Mission, and Core Values.
        - Vision & Mission are in a flex container with ID `vision-mission`.
        - Core Values are in a grid.
        - Icons (Font Awesome) added to Vision, Mission, and Core Value titles.
    - "Our Leaders": Displays Board of Trustees and Senior Management Team.
        - Each leader is in a `.leader-card` which is clickable to toggle a bio.
        - Images are dynamically loaded from `assets/images/leaders/` via a PHP mapping.
    - "About TSPI Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. (MBAI)": Contains information about MBAI and a link to its website.
        - Section ID: `about-tspi-mbai`.

### Styling:
- Page-specific styles are included in `<style>` tags within `AboutUs.php`.
- General section styling comes from `.about-section`.
- Leader cards have specific styling for layout, images, and bio toggle (including a CSS-generated dropdown arrow).
    - The bio toggle animation uses `ease-in-out` timing for a smoother feel.

### Functionality:
- Leader bios are toggled via JavaScript by clicking anywhere on the `.leader-card`.
- A sticky side navigation panel allows users to easily jump between sections of the page.
    - The panel is styled with `position: sticky` and a calculated `top` value to sit below the main site navbar.
    - It includes links to all major sections and sub-sections, which have corresponding `id` attributes.

## Header Navigation (includes/header.php)

- The "Who We Are" dropdown has been restructured:
    - "About Us" is now a primary link to `AboutUs.php` and also serves as a parent for a sub-dropdown.
    - The sub-dropdown under "About Us" includes:
        - "Mission & Vision" (links to `AboutUs.php#vision-mission`)
        - "Our Leaders" (links to `AboutUs.php#our-leaders`)
        - "Our Partner (MBAI)" (links to `AboutUs.php#about-tspi-mbai`)
    - "Board of Trustees" and "Management Team" items were removed from the main dropdown as they are covered under "Our Leaders".
- This structure is implemented for both desktop (hover-based dropdowns) and mobile (details/summary elements) navigation.
- CSS for sub-dropdowns has been added directly in `includes/header.php`.
