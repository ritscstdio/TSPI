## Global Page Layout and Navbar

The website uses a fixed header/navbar at the top of the page. To ensure page content is not obscured by this fixed navbar, a global CSS rule applies `padding-top: 166px;` (calculated based on the navbar's height) to the main HTML5 `<main>` element of all pages.

### Homepage Exception:

The homepage (`homepage.php`) is an exception. Its hero section is designed to appear directly under the navbar, with the navbar potentially overlaying the top portion of the hero's background video/image.
To achieve this:
1. `homepage.php` sets a PHP variable `$body_class = 'homepage-body';`.
2. This adds a class `homepage-body` to the `<body>` tag via `includes/header.php`.
3. A CSS rule `body.homepage-body main { padding-top: 0; }` in `src/css/mainstyles.css` overrides the global `padding-top` for the main content area of the homepage, allowing the hero section (the first child of `<main>`) to extend to the top of the viewport.

This setup ensures that new pages created will automatically have their main content start below the navbar, while the homepage maintains its specific hero section layout.
