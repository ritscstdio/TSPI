## Global Page Layout and Navbar

The website uses a fixed header/navbar at the top of the page. To ensure page content is not obscured by this fixed navbar, a global CSS rule applies `padding-top: 166px;` (calculated based on the navbar's height) to the main HTML5 `<main>` element of all pages.

### Homepage Exception:

The homepage (`homepage.php`) is an exception. Its hero section is designed to appear directly under the navbar, with the navbar potentially overlaying the top portion of the hero's background video/image.
To achieve this:
1. `homepage.php` sets a PHP variable `$body_class = 'homepage-body';`.
2. This adds a class `homepage-body` to the `<body>` tag via `includes/header.php`.
3. A CSS rule `body.homepage-body main { padding-top: 0; }` in `src/css/mainstyles.css` overrides the global `padding-top` for the main content area of the homepage, allowing the hero section (the first child of `<main>`) to extend to the top of the viewport.

This setup ensures that new pages created will automatically have their main content start below the navbar, while the homepage maintains its specific hero section layout.

## Cookie Consent Banner

A cookie consent banner is implemented to inform users about cookie usage and to obtain consent. It appears on all pages if the user has not previously accepted the cookie policy.

### Components:
1.  **HTML (in `includes/footer.php`):** Defines the structure of the banner, including a message, a link to the Privacy Policy page (`privacy.php`), and an "Accept" button.
2.  **CSS (in `src/css/mainstyles.css`):** Styles for `.cookie-consent-banner` and its child elements, ensuring it is fixed at the bottom right with a dark theme, consistent with company standards.
3.  **JavaScript (in `includes/footer.php`):
    *   Checks for a cookie named `tspi_cookie_consent` on page load.
    *   If the cookie is not found (new visitor or cookie expired), the banner is displayed (`banner.style.display = 'block';`).
    *   When the "Accept" button is clicked:
        *   A cookie named `tspi_cookie_consent` is set with the value `true` and an expiration of 365 days.
        *   The banner is hidden (`banner.style.display = 'none';`).
4.  **Privacy Policy Page (`privacy.php`):** A new page created with placeholder privacy policy content. It links from the cookie banner and the main site footer.

This ensures users are informed about cookie usage and can provide consent, which is stored for a year.

## About Us Page (AboutUs.php)

### Structure:
- Main container: `<main><div class="about-us-container">`
- Sections:
    - "About TSPI (Tulay Sa Pag-unlad Inc.) - NGO": Contains intro text, embedded YouTube video, Vision, Mission, and Core Values.
        - Vision & Mission are in a flex container with ID `vision-mission`.
        - Core Values are in a grid.
        - Icons (Font Awesome) added to Vision, Mission, and Core Value titles.
    - "Our Leaders": Displays Board of Trustees and Senior Management Team.
        - Each leader is in a `.leader-card` which is clickable to toggle a bio.
        - Images are dynamically loaded from `assets/images/leaders/` via a PHP mapping.
    - "About TSPI Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. (MBAI)": Contains information about MBAI and a link to its website.
        - Section ID: `about-tspi-mbai`.

### Styling:
- Page-specific styles are included in `<style>` tags within `AboutUs.php`.
- General section styling comes from `.about-section`.
- Leader cards have specific styling for layout, images, and bio toggle (including a CSS-generated dropdown arrow).
    - The bio toggle animation uses `ease-in-out` timing for a smoother feel.

### Functionality:
- Leader bios are toggled via JavaScript by clicking anywhere on the `.leader-card`.
- A sticky side navigation panel allows users to easily jump between sections of the page.
    - The panel is styled with `position: sticky` and a calculated `top` value to sit below the main site navbar.
    - It includes links to all major sections and sub-sections, which have corresponding `id` attributes.

### Recent Major Features/Changes:
*   **"Our Branches" Section Added (October 2023):**
    *   A new section displaying TSPI branch information, including Head Office details and regional/provincial branches.
    *   Branch information is structured with regions, provinces, branch names, addresses, and contact numbers.
    *   Styling: Implemented a 3-column grid layout for branch items within each province for better readability on larger screens, responsive to 2 columns and then 1 column on smaller screens.
    *   Interactivity: Branch contact numbers are clickable and will copy the number to the user's clipboard. A visual confirmation ("Copied!") is briefly displayed.
    *   Navigation: 
        *   Added to the sticky side navigation on the About Us page.
        *   (Pending) To be added to the main site navigation under "Who We Are" > "About Us" > "Our Branches" (after Mission & Vision).
*   **Fixed Navbar Offset:** Applied `scroll-margin-top: var(--navbar-scroll-offset);` to all section IDs (`#about-tspi-ngo`, `#our-leaders`, `#about-tspi-mbai`, `#vision-mission`, `#core-values`, `#board-of-trustees`, `#senior-management-team`, `#our-branches`) to prevent content from being hidden behind the fixed navbar during in-page navigation.
*   **"Our Leaders" Section:** This section was temporarily removed during an edit but has been restored. It displays information about the Board of Trustees and Senior Management Team.

**Structure of "Our Branches":**
```html
<section id="our-branches">
  <h2>Our Branches</h2>
  <p class="branch-section-intro">...</p>
  <div class="head-office-details">...</div>
  <h3 class="branches-main-header">TSPI BRANCHES</h3>
  <div class="region-group" id="region-X">
    <h4>REGION NAME</h4>
    <div class="province-group" id="regionX-provinceY">
      <h5>PROVINCE NAME</h5>
      <div class="branch-items-grid"> <!-- This div enables the 3-column layout -->
        <div class="branch-item">
          <p class="branch-name">BRANCH NAME</p>
          <p class="branch-address">ADDRESS</p>
          <p class="branch-contact">CONTACT INFO (Click to copy)</p>
        </div>
        <!-- ... more branch-items ... -->
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- ... more province-groups ... -->
  </div>
  <!-- ... more region-groups ... -->
</section>
```

**Key CSS for "Our Branches":**
*   `.branch-items-grid`: Uses `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);` for the 3-column layout.
*   Media queries adjust `grid-template-columns` for tablet and mobile views.
*   `.branch-contact`: Styled for interactivity (cursor, color change on copy).

**JavaScript for Copy-to-Clipboard (`AboutUs.php`):**
*   Selects all `.branch-contact` elements within the `#our-branches` section.
*   Adds a click event listener to each.
*   On click, copies the element's `innerText` to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`.
*   Provides visual feedback by temporarily changing the text to "Copied!" and then reverting.
*   Includes basic error handling.

## Header Navigation (includes/header.php)

- The "Who We Are" dropdown has been restructured:
    - "About Us" is now a primary link to `AboutUs.php` and also serves as a parent for a sub-dropdown.
    - The sub-dropdown under "About Us" includes:
        - "Mission & Vision" (links to `AboutUs.php#vision-mission`)
        - "Our Leaders" (links to `AboutUs.php#our-leaders`)
        - "Our Partner (MBAI)" (links to `AboutUs.php#about-tspi-mbai`)
    - "Board of Trustees" and "Management Team" items were removed from the main dropdown as they are covered under "Our Leaders".
- This structure is implemented for both desktop (hover-based dropdowns) and mobile (details/summary elements) navigation.
- CSS for sub-dropdowns has been added directly in `includes/header.php`.

## Project Overview

This project involves the development and refinement of a website for TSPI, a microfinance NGO. Key pages and features include:

*   **`AboutUs.php`**: A multi-section page providing comprehensive information about TSPI.
*   **`offers.php`**: A page detailing the various loan programs, social programs, and insurance products offered by TSPI.
*   **`awards.php`**: A page to showcase organizational and client awards, filterable by type.
*   **Dynamic Content**: Integration with a backend (presumably WordPress, based on `wp-content` paths and PHP functions like `get_template_directory_uri()`) to fetch data such as news contents, leader information, and client stories.
*   **Responsive Design**: Ensuring layouts adapt to various screen sizes.
*   **Interactive Elements**: Features like sticky navigation, collapsible sections, carousels, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
*   **Fixed Navbar Offset**: Consistent handling of in-page navigation to prevent content from being obscured by the fixed header.

## `AboutUs.php` Development

The `AboutUs.php` page has undergone significant development to present detailed information about the organization.

**Key Sections and Features:**

1.  **Initial Structure & Content:**
    *   Sections: "About TSPI (NGO)", "Vision & Mission", "Our Core Values", "Our Leaders", "Our Branches", "About TSPI-MBAI".
    *   Sticky side navigation for easy access to different sections.
    *   Main navigation in `includes/header.php` updated to link to new sections.

2.  **"Our Leaders" Section:**
    *   Displays Board of Trustees and Senior Management Team in card format.
    *   Each card includes an image, name, position, and a collapsible bio.
    *   Functionality to deep-link to a specific leader's card from other pages, automatically expanding their bio and scrolling into view, accounting for the fixed navbar.
    *   See `documentation/about_us_leaders_section.txt` for more details.

3.  **"Our Branches" Section:**
    *   Initially a long list, restyled into a 2-column grid for branch items within each collapsible province, under collapsible region headers.
    *   Copy-to-clipboard functionality for branch addresses.
    *   CSS-based image carousel for the Head Office.
    *   Moved to appear after "Our Leaders".
    *   See `documentation/about_us_branches_section.txt` for more details.

4.  **Navigation & General Page Enhancements:**
    *   Implementation of a CSS custom property `--navbar-scroll-offset` for `scroll-margin-top` on all in-page navigation targets.
    *   Updates to main header navigation (`includes/header.php`), including mobile navigation fixes.
    *   Refinements to the sticky side navigation.

## `offers.php` Development

The `offers.php` page was created to showcase TSPI's various programs and services.

**Key Features and Sections:**

1.  **Creation & Initial Content:**
    *   Sections for "Livelihood Loan Programs", "Social Loan Programs", and "Life Insurance and Credit Life Insurance Programs (KAAGAPAY)".
    *   Each section features multiple cards detailing specific offers with Font Awesome icons.
    *   Linked from "What We Offer" in the main navbar.

2.  **Styling & Animations:**
    *   Cards styled with white background, shadow, and rounded corners.
    *   Fade-up animation on load and hover animations for offer cards.

3.  **Intro Section Refinement:**
    *   Initially, an intro paragraph with a client story carousel below it.
    *   Restructured to a side-by-side layout:
        *   Left: Main intro text with `<h1>` "Our Commitment to Empowerment".
        *   Right: Client story carousel (fetching 3 recent 'stories' contents).
    *   Background changed to white, section width constrained and centered.

4.  **Program Section Restructuring & Content Updates:**
    *   "Life Insurance and Credit Life Insurance Programs" (KAAGAPAY) restored as a full, separate section with 6 detailed cards and a descriptive paragraph, appearing after "Social Loan Programs".
    *   "Social Loan Programs" section adjusted to display 4 cards in a row on wider screens.

## `awards.php` Development

*   Created from `news.php` to display contents with category slugs 'awards' or 'cliaward'.
*   Supports URL parameter `?type=organization` or `?type=client` for filtering.
*   Page title dynamically changes based on the filter.
*   Linked in the main navbar under "Who We Are".

## General Technical Notes

*   **Fixed Navbar Offset:** A CSS custom property `--navbar-scroll-offset` (derived from `--navbar-height` plus a buffer) is used with `scroll-margin-top` for all in-page navigation targets to prevent content from being hidden by the fixed navbar. This is applied globally via CSS.
*   **CSS Custom Properties:** `--navbar-height` and `--navbar-scroll-offset` are defined in a global stylesheet (e.g., `src/css/mainstyles.css` or equivalent) for consistent use.
*   **JavaScript:** Utilized for interactive elements like copy-to-clipboard, collapsible sections, carousels, and managing URL hash changes for scrolling and expanding content.

This document will be updated as the project progresses.

## Comment System Enhancements

For details on the new upvote and pinning features in the comment system, including database migration and code modifications, see [comment_system.txt](comment_system.txt).

## Admin Restructure: "Articles" → "Content" & Remove "Pages"

- The `articles` table and related tables (`article_categories`, `article_tags`, `article_votes`) have been renamed to `content`, `content_categories`, `content_tags`, and `content_votes` respectively. Foreign key constraints have been updated accordingly.
- All references to these tables have been updated throughout the codebase (SQL queries in PHP files).
- Column `article_id` has been renamed to `content_id` in all related tables and queries.
- After running the initial table rename migrations, you must rename the `article_id` column in the `comments` table to `content_id`. The SQL for this is provided in `documentation/rename_article_id_to_content_id.sql`.
- Admin CRUD pages for "Articles" have been renamed:
  - `admin/articles.php` → `admin/content.php`
  - `admin/add-article.php` → `admin/add-content.php`
  - `admin/edit-article.php` → `admin/edit-content.php`
- The "Pages" section (`pages.php`, `add-page.php`, `edit-page.php`) has been removed from the admin.
- Sidebar navigation updated: "Articles" now labeled "Content", "Pages" removed.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
- If you see errors related to `Unknown column 'content_id'` or similar, verify the SQL migration scripts were executed properly.
- Some PHP files may still reference the old column name `article_id`. These files need to be edited to reference `content_id` instead, or you need to maintain the old column name in your database.

## Membership Form

The website includes a comprehensive membership form for users to join TSPI. This feature allows users to sign up through two main entry points:

1. After successfully verifying their email account (from the verification page)
2. By clicking the "Join Us" button on the homepage

- Dynamic form elements (e.g., conditional spouse section, address selectors, dynamic income source fields).

### Key Technologies/Libraries Used:
- PHP for backend logic.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.
- jQuery for simplified JavaScript DOM manipulation and AJAX.
- `wilfredpine/philippine-address-selector` for Philippine address dropdowns (via CDN and direct jQuery AJAX calls to `ph-json` data).
- Pikaday.js for custom, consistent date picker UI across all date input fields.

### Membership Form (`user/membership-form.php`)

**Features:**
- Multi-page layout for better user experience.
    - Page 1: Personal Information.

- All new and modified fields need to be handled in the backend PHP script.

### Database
- Existing database (details to be provided by the user for any changes/additions).
- SQL queries related to database structure changes should be provided by the user.

### Installation/Setup (User Guide - `README.md`)
- Standard web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP) with PHP and MySQL.
- Place project files in the web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs`).
- Ensure the `ph-json` data from `wilfredpine/philippine-address-selector` is correctly placed in `assets/ph-json/` relative to the project root.
- Configure database connection in `includes/config.php` (assumption, needs verification).

### Developer Notes:
- **Navbar Offset:** `scroll-margin-top: var(--navbar-scroll-offset);` MUST be applied to elements used as anchor link targets. `--navbar-height` and `--navbar-scroll-offset` are defined in `src/css/mainstyles.css` (assumption, verify path or implement).
- **SQL Changes:** Any database schema modifications or new table additions must be reflected by updating or providing new SQL, which will be manually applied via phpMyAdmin or a similar tool.

## Membership Form Submissions and Signatures

A new `members_information` database table has been introduced to store multi-page membership form data, including:
- Personal info and birthdate
- An `age` column computed in PHP before database insertion. For example:
  ```php
  $birthDate = new DateTime($_POST['birthdate']);
  $today = new DateTime('today');
  $age = $birthDate->diff($today)->y;
  ```
- Address, business, spouse, beneficiaries, trustee details
- Paths to signature image files (`member_signature` and `beneficiary_signature`)

SQL for creating this table and associated triggers is documented in `documentation/members_table.txt`.

Signature images are exported as Base64-encoded PNGs via the Signature Pad API and saved under `/uploads/signatures`. PHP code ensures the directory exists and decodes/stores the image files, with file paths stored in the `members` table.
